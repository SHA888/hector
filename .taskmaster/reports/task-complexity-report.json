			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Project Structure and Configuration",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Setup Project Structure and Configuration' task into subtasks covering: 1) Creating the basic project structure and files, 2) Implementing the configuration schema and validation, and 3) Writing unit tests for configuration loading and validation.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves setting up the foundation of the project with multiple components. It requires creating the directory structure, implementing configuration loading from YAML, and adding validation logic. The complexity is moderate as it involves file operations, schema validation, and error handling, but uses standard libraries like PyYAML."

		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement GitHub API Scanner",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement GitHub API Scanner' task into subtasks covering: 1) Setting up the PyGithub client and query building, 2) Implementing pagination for search results, 3) Adding rate limit handling with backoff strategy, and 4) Creating repository data extraction and normalization.",
			"reasoning": "This task has higher complexity due to external API integration, pagination handling, and rate limit management. It requires understanding GitHub's API, implementing error handling for network issues, and designing a backoff strategy. The extraction of repository metadata also involves multiple API calls that need to be optimized."

		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Repository Scoring System",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Repository Scoring System' task into subtasks covering: 1) Implementing the base scoring algorithm with configurable weights, 2) Adding license scoring and validation, and 3) Implementing optional enhancements (recency decay, contributor factor, topic boost).",
			"reasoning": "This task involves creating a flexible scoring system with multiple weighted factors. The complexity comes from implementing different scoring algorithms, handling optional enhancements, and ensuring the system works with potentially missing data. Date calculations for recency decay add additional complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Repository Categorizer",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Repository Categorizer' task into subtasks covering: 1) Implementing keyword-based category matching logic, 2) Adding support for multi-category assignment and handling uncategorized repositories, and 3) Creating unit tests for different categorization scenarios.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires implementing text matching algorithms to categorize repositories based on keywords in their metadata. The complexity is moderate, involving regex pattern matching, handling multiple category assignments, and ensuring all repositories are categorized. The logic is self-contained with no external dependencies."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Markdown Renderer",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Markdown Renderer' task into subtasks covering: 1) Creating the core Markdown generation logic for repository data and categories, and 2) Implementing file output handling with proper formatting and error handling.",
			"reasoning": "This task is relatively straightforward, focusing on string formatting and file operations. The complexity is lower as it primarily involves converting structured data into Markdown format and writing to a file. The main challenges are ensuring consistent formatting and handling potential file system errors."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement VCS Integration",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement VCS Integration' task into subtasks covering: 1) Implementing change detection for output files, 2) Adding Git operations for committing and pushing changes, and 3) Creating pull request functionality using the GitHub API.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves integrating with Git and the GitHub API for version control operations. The complexity comes from executing shell commands, handling potential Git errors, and creating pull requests programmatically. It requires careful error handling and environment detection for GitHub Actions compatibility."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Main CLI Entry Point",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Main CLI Entry Point' task into subtasks covering: 1) Implementing command-line argument parsing and validation, 2) Creating the main orchestration logic to coordinate all components, and 3) Adding error handling and result reporting.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves creating the main orchestration logic that ties together all other components. The complexity is moderate as it requires coordinating multiple modules, handling command-line arguments, and implementing proper error handling. It's a critical component that needs to handle various failure scenarios gracefully."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Create GitHub Actions Workflow",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Create GitHub Actions Workflow' task into subtasks covering: 1) Creating the basic workflow configuration with scheduling and manual triggers, and 2) Setting up the Python environment and permissions for repository operations.",
			"reasoning": "This task is relatively simple, focusing on creating YAML configuration files for GitHub Actions. The complexity is low as it primarily involves configuring the workflow schedule, environment setup, and permissions. The main challenge is ensuring the correct permissions and environment variables are set."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Create Default Configuration and Documentation",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Create Default Configuration and Documentation' task into subtasks covering: 1) Creating a well-commented default configuration file, 2) Writing comprehensive README documentation with usage examples, and 3) Documenting the scoring methodology and customization options.",
			"reasoning": "This task focuses on creating documentation and default configuration. The complexity is moderate as it requires clear explanation of the tool's functionality, configuration options, and usage examples. It's important for user adoption but doesn't involve complex programming logic."
